                <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for 
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be 
                assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and 
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6" id="B"><h2>Css</h2>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for 
                    describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
                    language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World 
                    Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6" id="C"><h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
                    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-
                    level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-
                    bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
                    and first-class functions.</p
